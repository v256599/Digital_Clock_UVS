## Abstract
An abstract is a short summary of your project, usually about a paragraph (6-7 sentences, 150-250 words) long. A well-written abstract serves multiple purposes: (a) an abstract lets readers get the gist or essence of your project quickly; (b) an abstract prepares readers to follow the detailed information, description, and results in your report; (c) and, later, an abstract helps readers remember key points from your project.


## The main contributions of the project are:
-
-
-

[Photo(s) of your application with labels of individual parts.]

[Link to A3 project poster.]

[Optional: Link to your short video presentation.]


## Hardware description of demo application!

Describe your implementation. Put a descriptive top-level schematic of your application.


## Software description
Put flowchats/state diagrams of your algorithm(s) and direct links to source/testbench files in src and sim folders.


## Components simulations
- Component: clk_1hz
- Description: Clock divider to generate a 1 Hz output clock signal.
![tb_clk_1hz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02687ae-c638-4041-8d1e-12d92fb6eb9b)
- The input clock (clk_in) is a high-frequency signal (e.g., 100 MHz).
- The output clock (clk_out) is divided down to approximately 1 Hz.
